# Interesting-LC-Problems
Just my solutions to some problems that I'm solving that I found interesting, while learning.

Problems featured so far:  
Leetcode [474](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/description/)  
Leetcode [15](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)(not optimized, absolute brute force so 4 edge cases fail but should be good for CodeSignal because their test cases are usual lax compared to LC)  
Leetcode [300](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
